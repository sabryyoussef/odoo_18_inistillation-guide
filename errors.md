TROUBLESHOOTING SPECIFIC ERRORS
------------------------------

1. Python-LDAP Installation Error
--------------------------------
Error message:
fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
    9 | #include "Python.h"
       |          ^~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.

This error occurs when trying to build the python-ldap package during the 
'pip install -r requirements.txt' step. It happens because the Python 
development headers are missing.

Solution:
$ sudo apt-get install python3.12-dev

Explanation:
- The python-ldap package contains C extensions that need to be compiled
- Compilation requires Python development headers
- The python3.12-dev package provides these necessary header files
- After installing python3.12-dev, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' again

Note: If you're using a different Python version, adjust the package name 
accordingly (e.g., python3.11-dev for Python 3.11)
